# ü§ñ Multi-Agent Research Assistant
An AI-Powered Research and Report-Writing Application

This project is a sophisticated multi-agent system built with **LangChain** that automates the end-to-end process of researching a given topic and generating a comprehensive, well-structured report. By orchestrating a team of specialized AI agents, the application efficiently handles complex tasks that would typically require manual effort.

The user provides a topic through a simple web interface, and the agents work together to deliver a final, polished Markdown report.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
The system's core is a collaborative team of three distinct agents: a **Researcher**, a **Summarizer**, and a **Writer**. Each agent has a unique role, prompt, and a set of tools, allowing for a structured and reliable workflow.

### Production-Ready Enhancements
The system is built for a production environment, featuring a robust testing suite, security guardrails, and graceful error handling to ensure reliability and safety.

### Custom Tooling
Agents are equipped with robust LangChain-compatible tools including:
- **ddgs** for web searching  
- **scrape_website** for scraping web content  
- **file-saving functionality**  

### Google Gemini API Integration
All agents use the **Google Gemini API** for advanced reasoning and text generation.

### Interactive Web Interface
Built with **Gradio**, the interface allows users to input a topic and view the final report in real-time.

## üîí Production-Readiness Enhancements

### Robust Testing Strategy
The project includes a comprehensive test suite using **pytest**:
- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual components in isolation.  
- **Integration Tests**: Confirm that different parts work together as expected.  
- **System Tests**: Perform an end-to-end workflow validation.  

### Safety & Security Guardrails
- **Input Validation**: Prevents off-topic or inappropriate requests.  
- **Output Validation**: Ensures correctness and relevance at every step.  
- **Resilient Retry Mechanism**: Retries failed tasks before stopping.  

### Deployment and Monitoring
- Easy deployment on **Hugging Face Spaces**.  
- `requirements.txt` handles dependencies.  
- Gradio interface is production-ready.
